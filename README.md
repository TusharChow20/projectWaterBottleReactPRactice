# ⚡ React + Vite

This is a **practice project** I created while learning React.  
It’s built with **Vite** for a fast and modern development workflow. The setup includes **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** and a basic **ESLint configuration** to maintain clean code. 🚀

Currently, two official plugins are available for React integration:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) → uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) → uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for blazing-fast Fast Refresh

## 🔧 ESLint Configuration

For **production-ready applications**, it’s recommended to use **TypeScript** with type-aware linting rules enabled.  
You can explore the official [React + TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for guidance on integrating TypeScript with [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io).

# ⚡ React + Vite Shopping Cart

Welcome to my **React Practice Project**! 🎉  
This project was built while learning **React** and **Vite** — designed purely for **practice and experimentation** (⚠️ _not responsive, not production-ready_).

---

## 🌟 Project Highlights

- 🚀 **Built with Vite** → Ultra-fast dev server
- ⚛️ **React Components** → Practiced state, props & JSX
- 🛒 **Shopping Cart with Local Storage**
  - Add, edit, or remove items from cart
  - Cart data is saved in **localStorage** (persists even after page refresh)
  - Great for practicing **CRUD operations** with state + browser storage
- 🧹 **ESLint Configured** → Keeps code clean and consistent

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **React 18**
- **Vite** for modern development workflow
- **ESLint** for linting and code style

Optional plugins for React integration with Vite:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react) → uses **Babel** for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) → uses **SWC** for blazing-fast refresh

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

👉 This is a **practice-only project**.  
👉 The UI is **not responsive**.  
👉 The goal was **learning React & localStorage**, not creating a polished app.

## 🚀 Next Steps (Future Practice Ideas)

- Add responsive design with **Tailwind CSS**
- Try out **React Router** for multiple pages
- Introduce **Context API / Redux** for global state management
- Implement **TypeScript** + stricter ESLint rules
